# About

I am currently a final-year student at DigiPen Institute of Technology, studying *Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation*.

As a software engineer, my passion is in building experiences that makes life easier, and I enjoy using my technical knowledge with a keen eye for details to target pain points in everyday interactions.

I have a keen interest in Web3 development, and focus more on backend development, low-level optimisation and system architecture. Throughout my past projects, I have specialised in mathematics and physics simulations for fully featured custom built game engines.

**When I'm not in front of a computer screen**, I'm probably practicing dance, taking a swim or playing tennis, or cooking and making cocktails.

I also occassionally write on my blog (and on Medium) to share my knowledge with the world.

<!-- By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories). -->
