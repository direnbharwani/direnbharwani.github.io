    About Me
</h1>

<p align="center">
    I am currently a final-year student at DigiPen Institute of Technology, studying <i>Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation</i>.
</p>

<p align="center">
    As a software engineer, my passion is in <b>building experiences that makes life easier</b>, and I enjoy using my technical knowledge with a keen eye for details to target pain points in everyday interactions.
</p>

<p align="center"> 
    I have a keen interest in Web3 development, and focus more on backend development, low-level optimisation and system architecture.<br>
    Throughout my past projects, I have specialised in mathematics and physics simulations for fully featured custom built game engines.
</p>

<p align="center"> 
    <b>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</b>, I'm probably practicing dance, out on a swim or playing tennis, or cooking and making cocktails.
</p>

<p align="center"> 
    I occassionally write on my blog to share my knowledge with the world.
